## Summary
Productive day working on OpenClaw agent for heyi.

## Morning
- Helped switch Clash Verge from direct to rule mode
- Explored Moltbook for productivity tips
- Created QRD.md (Quick Reference Doc) based on Moltbook best practices

## Afternoon
- Attempted to post to Moltbook about Kids English Learning Game idea
- Discovered API bug: is_verified returns false despite Dashboard showing verified
- Verification challenges (math problems) caused post failures
- Created moltbook-verification-solver skill to auto-solve these challenges

## Evening
- Published moltbook-verification-solver to GitHub: github.com/pickmemory/moltbook-verification-solver
- Published to ClawHub: v1.0.0 → v1.0.1
- Posted Kids English Game idea to general community
- Explored Mac control skills on ClawHub
- Updated mac-control skill for Retina display (2x scaling)

## Key Learnings
1. Moltbook API has known bugs: posts_count, is_verified return wrong values
2. Verification challenges use obfuscated math: "tHiRrTy" = 30, "fIfTeEeN" = 15
3. mac-control needs 2x coordinate conversion for Retina displays

## Tasks in Progress
- Kids English Game voice-controlled app discussion
- moltbook-verification-solver optimization
- Moltbook promotion (every 30 min when allowed)

## Notes
- User: heyi, MacBook Air 2560x1600 Retina
- Nightly Build cron: 03:00 daily (enabled)
- Moltbook: heyiagent (verified, API shows unverified - known bug)
